Most of us tend to have a hard time navigating what to eat versus what not to eat during the holiday season. The most common approaches when it comes to the holidays are either to restrict all favorite foods in an attempt to avoid weight gain, or toss out all self-control hoping our post-holiday diet will reverse the damage.  Unfortunately, these diet-mentalities don’t work long term and can lead to an unhealthy relationship with food.  Thankfully there’s another approach: mindfulness.  Here are a few ways to accomplish this during the month of November and onward:

Take the 10-Chew Test. It takes about 10 chews for your mind to get the maximum satisfaction out of what you eat.  When you are served your favorite holiday foods, chew each bite at least 10 times.  This allows you to enjoy the food more, meaning it will be easier to push away from the table when both your brain and belly are happy.
Avoid Classifying Food. When we classify foods as “bad,” we fall into a cycle of “I cheated and ate a piece of cake so the rest of my day is ruined.”  This food categorization confuses us by meshing positive emotions and brain signals with negative thoughts of failure.  This emotional turmoil leads to stress, which eventually ends in emotional eating.  Instead, eat the cake – or whatever your favorite food – but eat it more mindfully.  This is a perfect opportunity to try out the 10-chew test.
 
We are conducting a study to better understand your campus dining satisfaction and preferences. By sharing your thoughts, we will gain valuable insight to help improve your overall experience. 
This online survey will take no more than 10 minutes and your responses are confidential.
The survey is mobile-friendly and can be taken on a smartphone, mobile device, or a computer.

March is National Nutrition month which means it’s a great time to get back to eating healthy! However, with Spring comes new fad diets promising to get you ready for shorts and sandals weather. Being healthy does not mean you have to follow a drastic diet plan or restrict your food intake. In fact, that can be harmful to your body. Instead of following a fad diet, try out these simple healthy eating tips.


If you find yourself eating on-the-go or while studying in the library, you may want to pack some healthy snacks. Rather than reaching for chips or cookies, try taking some carrots with hummus or celery with peanut butter. The vegetables are a great source of fiber and vitamins while the hummus or peanut butter offer a source of protein and healthy fats which will help you stay full longer.


Be mindful of your body’s ques for when you are full or when you are hungry. Mindless eating, such as munching on a snack while studying or stress-eating, can cause unintended weight gain. On the flip side, feeling hungry and neglecting to give your body food in an effort to lose weight is very harmful. Try to be aware of when and how you eat and respect your body’s needs.


This diet does not mean you have to eat Mediterranean inspired foods. It is based on the eating patterns that people in the Mediterranean use which has been shown to have great health benefits. The diet principles are based on eating whole grains, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats and reducing saturated fat (which can lead to heart disease if eaten in excess). A few Mediterranean diet tips that can be easily incorporated are choosing to eat nuts for a healthy snack, eating whole wheat bread, and limiting red meal to only three meals per week.

Roses are red, violets are blue, dark chocolate is yummy and has added benefits too!

 

Now that we are entering February, thoughts of chocolate, flowers and teddy bears are probably rolling through your minds. You may even find yourself fixated on one item in particular…chocolate! Knowing which type of chocolate to buy can be challenging. In today’s market, there are so many different types and flavors of chocolate, including dark chocolate. Dark Chocolate is known to positively affect your overall health, one serving at a time. This is why choosing your chocolate wisely can be a first step towards a more heart healthy you!

 

Fun Facts. Dark chocolate is one of the few tasty food items that helps regulate blood sugar. It does this by increasing insulin sensitivity, which then makes it easier to control blood sugar levels. It also contains Flavanols which support heart health by aiding in blood vessel relaxation which helps to lower blood pressure. Lastly, dark chocolate is also rich in multiple nutrients including iron, copper, magnesium, zinc and phosphorous!

 

What You Can Do. Try to purchase dark chocolate with 70% or higher cocoa content. This tends to have the highest amount of Flavanols, which means the most benefit. A serving of dark chocolate is about one square. Adding a square or two of dark chocolate after a meal can act as a nutrient packed dessert or help you get those added nutrients you may have missed. Eating modest amounts of dark chocolate, can help to meet your additional nutrition needs, one square at a time!

Happy New Year Mustangs! If you’re still on track with your New Year’s resolutions, great job! If your resolutions lasted a few days, no shame – now is a great time to pick them back up or reinforce them with these three tips:

 

Create an action plan: How will you break your resolution down into actionable steps? What will success look like to you? If you want to exercise more and eat healthier, set an actionable goal of exercising three times a week and eating a piece of fruit after lunch instead of a sugary dessert. Lofty goals without a game plan on how to accomplish them usually fade with time.

 

Pace yourself. “Slow and steady wins the race.” Start with small, achievable changes and build from there. When it comes to improving your diet, focus on healthful foods you can add to your diet instead of foods you want to remove. For example, start by adding one more colorful fruit or vegetable to your plate at each meal. Once you’ve mastered that, consider reducing sugary beverages by one a day or one a week. Before you know it, you’ve created a lasting lifestyle change instead of a short-term quick-fix diet.

 

Stay positive. Find enjoyment in your resolution. Eat nutritious foods you like, and choose physical activities you love. If you hate running on the treadmill, a resolution to run every day won’t last long. You’ll have more success maintaining your healthier lifestyle if you are enjoying yourself Every day is a new opportunity to focus on your goals and appreciate your achievements – give yourself grace when you slip up and don’t give up.
