The SMU Jewish Studies Program’s Nate and Ann Levine Lecture Series welcomes Dr. Daniel Cohen, associate professor of history and Jewish studies at Rice University. He has published on forced displacement, Jewish migration, human rights, and refugees in the twentieth century. His talk will address how post-WWII European secular and Christian “philosemites” imagined various types of loveable “good Jews.” Cohen will explore the complexity of this newfound sympathy and explain how today's antisemitic portrait of the cosmopolitan Jew or demonic Israeli continues to fuel antisemitic paranoia. For more information, please contact Shira Lander at jewishstudies@smu.edu.

Dr. Marcus Butts, Management and Organizations Department chairperson in the Cox School of Business, will discuss how academic literature is replete with studies looking at between-person relationships cross-sectionally or with time-lagged data and how he advocates for a more focused “within-person” approach to understanding the employee perspective. This approach utilizes experience sampling methodology (ESM), whereby employees are surveyed across multiple days in a row to better capture how ebbs and flows in experiences from day-to-day can explain fluctuations in attitudes and behaviors. He will provide a brief glimpse into ESM, how it is typically utilized, and some of the pitfalls of its use and review three of his previous ESM studies. For more information, please contact Lisa Ruano at lruano@smu.edu.

The SMU Department of Mathematics welcomes Professor Guillaume Bal from the University of Chicago for a lecture discussing topological invariants for interface modes.

Dr. Michael Chmielewski, associate professor of psychology, examines recent data quality concerns regarding Amazon’s MTurk crowdsourcing service.

Dr. Chmielewski will present results of a recent study (Chmielewski & Kucker, 2019) demonstrating a substantial decrease in data quality using a four-wave naturalistic experimental design: pre-, during, and post-summer 2018. He will also report ways to mitigate these problems and offer suggestions to ensure data quality moving forward.  For more information, please contact Lisa Ruano at lruano@smu.edu.

The Asian Studies Lecture Series is pleased to present Dr. David H. Slater, professor at Sophia University, Tokyo and Dr. Robin O’Day, assistant professor at University of North Georgia. Their talk, “Seeking Asylum in Japan: An oral narrative approach to asylum seekers’ experiences in Tokyo,” addresses the number of refugees applying for asylum in Japan.

A word from the chairman.
Hey there Boys and girls and grown-ups too. I am fired up and honored to present to you the second Anime Dallas. Coming to you in November of 2019!!! Texas is an anime Mecca, and I decided to put on Anime Dallas as an experience where my friends and I get to share even more anime excitement (and maybe some whiskey) with you!

Our first year had more than sixteen amazing guests, and over 2,000 wonderful anime fans showed up. We can’t wait to show you what we have in store for the next convention.

We want Anime Dallas to be a fun experience that is really fan-focused. It’s not all about big money. It’s about you. We want this to be a big anime party where you’re king. Thank you for looking at Anime Dallas and we will see you in November.

Let’s party!!!
